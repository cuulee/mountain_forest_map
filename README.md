# A mountain forest map

Code in this project generates a mountain forest map generated according to FAO guidelines. Within the context of the CLIMO COST action there was a need for a mountain forest map (EU wide if not global), as defined by FAO rules. These rules specify that forests above 300 m and with a considerable slope are "mountain forest". I put together a Google Earth Engine worked example to generate this data (see src directory).

Currently the map generated by the code uses the FAO 300 m threshold, together with an arbitrary 5% slope value. The land cover data used is the most common value per pixel of the MODIS Collection 6 Land Cover map (2001 - 2016). Data is exported at a 500 m resolution, the native resolution of the MODIS product.

An interactive map of the generated product can be found in the included tiles, the final data at native resolution is included in the data directory.
