# A mountain forest map

Code in this project generates a mountain forest map according to FAO guidelines. Within the context of the [CLIMO COST action](http://climo.unimol.it/) there was a need for a mountain forest map (EU wide if not global), as defined by FAO rules. These rules specify that forests above 300 m and with a considerable slope are "mountain forest". I put together a Google Earth Engine worked example to generate this data (see [source directory](https://github.com/khufkens/mountain_forest_map/tree/master/src)).

Currently the map generated by the code uses the FAO 300 m threshold, together with an arbitrary 5% slope value. The land cover data used is the most common value per pixel of the MODIS Collection 6 Land Cover map (2001 - 2016). Data is exported, for the EU, at a 500 m resolution, the native resolution of the MODIS product. However, a global product may be generated given the global nature of the MODIS land cover product.

An interactive map of the EU data, as provided in the [data directory](https://github.com/khufkens/mountain_forest_map/tree/master/data), can be [here](https://khufkens.github.io/mountain_forest_map/).
